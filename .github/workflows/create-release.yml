name: Build Release Package

# This workflow creates a production-ready release package for the Wuunder Shipping plugin
# and optionally deploys it to WordPress.org SVN repository.
#
# Triggers:
# - Creating a GitHub release (builds and attaches package)
# - Publishing a GitHub release (builds, attaches, and deploys to SVN)
# - Manual workflow dispatch with optional SVN deployment
# - Local testing with act: `act workflow_dispatch`
#
# The workflow:
# 1. Reads version from the main plugin file (wuunder-shipping.php)
# 2. Installs production dependencies (PHP/Node)
# 3. Builds production assets (CSS/JS)
# 4. Creates a distribution package excluding development files (via .distignore)
# 5. Generates SHA256 checksum for security
# 6. Uploads the package to GitHub release (if triggered by release)
# 7. Deploys to WordPress.org SVN (if release is published or deploy_to_svn=true)
